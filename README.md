# Sleepy Weather

**Starting from absolute zero and assuming nothing about my knowledge of UX Design**

Challenge from Marg: [This gist](https://gist.github.com/margueriteroth/6823fcc6eeec9c11d9162a6d22c7fb0e)

## Notes so far (last updated 12/6/2020)

* Inspiration: weather.com, accuweather.com, ny1.com
* Common UX concepts:
  * A list of similar looking components that only show high/low temps at first, then expand for more information
  * Most important information is bigger and more prominent
  * Key information: Daily high/low temps, humidity, precipitation chance, wind speed
