## Notes so far (last updated 12/07/2020)

* Inspiration: weather.com, accuweather.com, ny1.com
* Common UX concepts:
  * A list of similar looking components that only show high/low temps at first, then expand for more information
  * Most important information is bigger and more prominent
  * Key information: Daily high/low temps, humidity, precipitation chance, wind speed
* Will provide an "Overnight" metric that shows a high and low temp for the hours between 6p-6a for days in the next week
